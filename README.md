# FS-Regenerative-Battery-Model
Impact: Boosted energy recovery from &lt;1% to 20% per lap. I diagnosed critical hardware flaws in the BMS (IC supply/isolation) and developed a high-fidelity Battery Model (ECM) via experimental Cell Testing. This allowed the team to break a 7-year streak and complete the 22km Endurance Event for the first time since 2017.
